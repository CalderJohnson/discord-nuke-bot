# nuke-bot

Example creation of how a destructive bot could be used to wrongfully "nuke" or destroy a discord server

**Commands:**

!clear: deletes all channels and roles

!massban: generates a user list then attempts to ban each one

!channel x: creates x channels and uses webhooks to spam ping

!alert: spam pings (this can be stacked)

!nuke: all of the above


I do not condone this use of this bot to damage peoples servers! Educational purposes only.

NOTES: Use on a VPN or you may be IP banned. Also, remember to enable special intents when you create your bots client in the developer portal.
